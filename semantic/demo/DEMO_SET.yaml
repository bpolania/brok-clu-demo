# Phase S-2: Curated Product Demonstration Set
#
# DERIVED, NON-AUTHORITATIVE
#
# This file defines the curated subset of inputs for the product-facing
# demonstration. All inputs are drawn from Phase S-1 SES_001.
#
# Constraint: No new semantic inputs created in S-2.
# Available inputs: 3 (from SES_001_restart_alpha.yaml)
#
# Authoritative output remains: artifacts/run/.../stdout.raw.kv

demo_id: DEMO_S2_001
title: "Semantic Capability Demonstration - Bounded Paraphrase Behavior"
description: |
  This demo shows behavior, not correctness of meaning.

  Demonstrates end-to-end behavior when semantic inputs are processed
  through the frozen PoC v2 runtime, showing both runtime guarantees
  and semantic variability across paraphrases.

source_suite: SES_001
source_file: semantic/suites/SES_001_restart_alpha.yaml

# Curated input count: 3
# Note: Phase S-2 does not create new inputs; uses existing S-1 inputs only.

inputs:

  - id: demo_input_01
    source: "SES_001/input_01"
    input_string: "restart alpha subsystem gracefully"
    category: happy_path
    intended_meaning_note: "Request to restart the alpha subsystem using graceful mode"
    expected_demo_point: "Shows baseline runtime behavior with successful verification and execution"

  - id: demo_input_02
    source: "SES_001/input_02"
    input_string: "graceful restart of alpha"
    category: paraphrase_diverge
    intended_meaning_note: "Alternate phrasing for restarting alpha subsystem gracefully"
    expected_demo_point: "Shows that paraphrased inputs may produce differing authoritative outputs"

  - id: demo_input_03
    source: "SES_001/input_03"
    input_string: "please restart the alpha subsystem in graceful mode"
    category: paraphrase_diverge
    intended_meaning_note: "Polite variant requesting graceful restart of alpha subsystem"
    expected_demo_point: "Shows semantic variability—same intended action, different output metadata"

divergence_observed: true
divergence_note: |
  Phase S-1 classified SES_001 as DIVERGENT.
  Byte-for-byte comparison of stdout.raw.kv showed differences.
  Observed cause: embedded temp file paths in PoC v2 output vary per run.
  This is documented honestly; divergence is not hidden.
