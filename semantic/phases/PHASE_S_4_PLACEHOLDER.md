# Phase S-4: Integrated Product Demo Planning

**Status:** COMPLETE

---

## Description

Phase S-4 composes existing frozen phases (V2-*, S-1, S-2, S-3) into a unified product demo surface.

This phase adds documentation and framing only. No executable logic, no behavior changes, no new guarantees.

---

## Deliverables

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `semantic/demo/INTEGRATED_PRODUCT_DEMO.md` | Primary demo entrypoint |
| `semantic/demo/INTEGRATED_WALKTHROUGH.md` | Linear command sequence |
| `semantic/contract/PHASE_S_4_SCOPE_LOCK.md` | Phase scope lock |
| `semantic/phases/PHASE_S_4_PLACEHOLDER.md` | This file |

## What S-4 Does

- Presents runtime and semantic layers as a unified demo
- Documents authoritative vs derived output boundaries
- Provides audience-specific navigation paths
- References existing commands and artifacts

---

## What S-4 Does NOT Do

- Modify PoC v2 bundle or behavior
- Modify verification/execution scripts
- Add semantic tolerance or normalization
- Claim semantic correctness
- Hide or soften divergence
- Re-interpret earlier phase results
