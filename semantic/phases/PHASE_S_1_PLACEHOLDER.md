# Phase S-1: Input Suite & Equivalence Classes

**Status:** NOT STARTED

---

## Description

Phase S-1 will define and create the frozen input suite for semantic capability demonstration. Inputs will be grouped into semantic equivalence classes (paraphrases, slot variations, semantic rejects, structural rejects) and persisted as single-line UTF-8 text files compatible with PoC v2.

This phase executes under the constraints defined in Phase S-0 and cannot weaken those constraints. All inputs are illustrative, not exhaustive, and no claims of paraphrase completeness or general language understanding are permitted.

## Contract Reference

This phase is governed by: **[Phase S-0: Scope Lock & Contract Definition](../contract/PHASE_S_0_SCOPE_LOCK.md)**
