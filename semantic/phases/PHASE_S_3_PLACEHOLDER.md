# Phase S-3: Optional Semantic Regression Gate

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED (mutable until explicit closure)

---

## Description

Phase S-3 is an optional regression gate for semantic consistency. This phase operates strictly under the constraints defined in Phase S-0 and cannot weaken those constraints.

If implemented, this phase provides a mechanism to detect semantic drift across runs. All checks are layer-owned and non-authoritative. No claims of general language understanding or production readiness are permitted.

## Contract Reference

This phase is governed by: **[Phase S-0: Scope Lock & Contract Definition](../contract/PHASE_S_0_SCOPE_LOCK.md)**
