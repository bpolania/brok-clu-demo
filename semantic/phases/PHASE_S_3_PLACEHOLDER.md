# Phase S-3: Presentation & Summary

**Status:** NOT STARTED

---

## Description

Phase S-3 will produce audit-grade summaries and PASS/FAIL results for the semantic capability demonstration. Presentation will be factual and narrow, favoring auditability over flash. All summaries are derived views and explicitly non-authoritative; the underlying `stdout.raw.kv` outputs remain the sole source of truth.

This phase executes under the constraints defined in Phase S-0 and cannot weaken those constraints. Non-claims must be preserved in all presentation materials—no implication of general language understanding, paraphrase completeness, or production readiness.
