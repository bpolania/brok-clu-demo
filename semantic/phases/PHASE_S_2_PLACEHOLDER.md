# Phase S-2: Curated Product Demonstration

**Status:** NOT STARTED

## Description

Phase S-2 presents illustrative semantic capabilities for product understanding. This phase operates strictly under the constraints defined in Phase S-0 and cannot weaken those constraints.

All presentation is bounded and illustrative. No claims of general language understanding, paraphrase completeness, or production readiness are permitted. Derived views are explicitly non-authoritative.

## Contract Reference

This phase is governed by: **[Phase S-0: Scope Lock & Contract Definition](../contract/PHASE_S_0_SCOPE_LOCK.md)**
