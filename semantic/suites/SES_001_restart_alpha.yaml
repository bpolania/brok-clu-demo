# SES_001: Restart Alpha Paraphrase Set
#
# Semantic Equivalence Set for demonstrating paraphrase collapse.
# All inputs in this set express the same intent (RESTART_SUBSYSTEM)
# with the same target (alpha) and mode (graceful).
#
# This is an ILLUSTRATIVE, BOUNDED, CURATED set.
# No claims of completeness or general language understanding.

title: "Restart Alpha Graceful - Paraphrase Set"
description: |
  Demonstrates that multiple surface forms expressing the same semantic
  intent produce identical authoritative outputs from PoC v2.

  Expected behavior: All inputs should yield byte-identical stdout.raw.kv
  if the compiled language correctly collapses paraphrases.

  NOTE: This is a derived, non-authoritative classification.
  Authoritative output is stdout.raw.kv only.

inputs:
  - "restart alpha subsystem gracefully"
  - "graceful restart of alpha"
  - "please restart the alpha subsystem in graceful mode"
